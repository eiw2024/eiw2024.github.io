The third version of the Edge Intelligence Workshop (EIW- III) will focus on the edge deployment of large language and vision models; and how to make them more efficient in terms of **Data**, **Model**, **Training**, and **Inference** specially on edge devices.

This is an interdisciplinary research topic that covers the theory, hardware, and software aspects of AI models, targeting large language and vision models.

The workshop program offers an interactive platform for gathering different experts and talents from different research areas from academia and industry through invited talks, panel discussions, paper submissions, reviews, interactive posters, and oral presentations. This will be a unique opportunity to discuss and share challenging problems, build connections, exchange ideas brainstorm solutions, and foster future collaborations in this fast-paced research domain.
